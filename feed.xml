                <h1>Hey Friends ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Jackson. I am a homeschooled high school student. I am a reader, coder, aspiring entrepreneur, and a child of God. I love to be productive, to be helpful, to give, and to get stuff done. I like to study, work, eat, read, live, and run. My day generally starts at 5AM and ends at 8PM. Every day I spend 2 hours of my time participating in productive recreation. My pleasure reading generally consists of historical fiction or historical non-fiction.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Some random facts about me:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I design, code, live, serve, excercise and work.</li>
<li>I look forward to the future.</li>
<li>I am passionate about history.</li>
<li>I am a writer, reader, efficiency enthusiast, homeschooler, and a Christian.</li>
<li>My goal is projection, not perfection.</li>
<li>The wind blows, time flies, and I run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Â </p>
<p>I like to think that I have a big imagination. I would rather do an extra Algebra lesson than eat a mushroom. I would rather write an extra paper than do an extra Algebra lesson. I love Algebra. I hate mushrooms. My pet-peeve is getting interupted for no reason at all. I have 8 cute siblings.</p>
